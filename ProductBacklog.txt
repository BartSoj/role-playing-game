hand in this backlog Tuesday October 10, 2023 before 23:59 on Canvas

A product backlog is a list of features (backlog items) that your game will contain. The backlog items need
to be relatively small and self-contained, i.e. a small unit you can work on and finish relatively quickly
and independently of the other backlog-items. The backlog items need to be sorted by priority from high
to low and need to contain the following information per item:

Name 
This should be a succinct descriptor of what your backlog item is about (e.g. “Rendering a chess
board”).

How to demo 
How exactly are you going to demonstrate that your backlog item is implemented properly
(e.g. “Start the application, click the New Game button and 64 white and black square fields show up
in a checkerboard pattern, resize window, board stays square and properly visible”).

Notes
Here you can elaborate more on the backlog item and write down which learning goals you want
to achieve with this backlog item (e.g. “Rendering by painting a JPanel component, dynamically
resizing board based on window size — learning how to render on swing components, basic pro-
gramming.”).
