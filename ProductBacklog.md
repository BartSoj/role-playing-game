# Product Backlog

A product backlog is a list of features (backlog items) that your game will contain. The backlog items need
to be relatively small and self-contained, i.e. a small unit you can work on and finish relatively quickly
and independently of the other backlog-items. The backlog items need to be sorted by priority from high
to low and need to contain the following information per item:

## Create a project with Maven

## Add required dependencies to Maven

## Create Github repository

## Add project to Github

## Create a basic GUI form

## Add user Input Handling

### How to demo

Write the message, send it and see if it appears in the chat window.

### Notes

Set up a mechanism to receive text inputs from the player and display this input. This can be done through a text field
to receive the input and Text Area to display the input with Button to send the input.

## Integration with the Assistant

### How to demo

Write the message and see if assistant gives the response.

### Notes

integrate Ai assistant into your game by making API calls to the OpenAI GPT-3 to generate responses based on player
input. Add response to the chat window.

## Game State Management

### Notes

Keep track of the game state, such as the player's inventory, progress, and location, so you can provide context-aware
responses and tasks.

## Game Logic

### Notes

Create the game's logic, including the world, characters, quests, and actions that the player can take. Use the
responses generated by the Assistant to provide narrative context and feedback to the player.

## Narrative Design

### Notes

Plan out the storyline, quests, and adventures.

## Add logging

### Notes

add logging framework for easier debugging and error handling.

## Add unit tests

### How to demo

Run the unit tests and ensure that they all pass.

### Notes

Write unit tests for all the game's logic and functionality to ensure that the game is working as expected.

## Testing and Iteration

### How to demo

Test the game by playing through it and interacting with the Assistant. Ensure that the game is playable and that the
Assistant is generating responses that make sense.

### notes

Thoroughly test the game to ensure that interactions with the Assistant work smoothly and that the narrative flows well.
Iterate on the game design and story based on player feedback.

## Scaling

### Notes

As game progresses, add more features, locations, and complexity to the storyline to keep players engaged.

## Add user manual

### How to demo

Click a button "help" and a window appears with instructions on how to play the game.

### Notes

Provide clear instructions and guides for player on how to interact with the game.

## Add code documentation

### Notes

Add code documentation to the project.

## Create good game UI

### Notes

Add background image, frame borders, change font, etc.

## Add README.md

### Notes

Add a README.md file to the project to provide information about the project and how to run it.

## Make executable jar file

### Notes

Compile and package the game into a jar file for easier execution.
